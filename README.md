**Business Problem**


A gaming company wants to create level-based new customer personas using certain characteristics of their customers and estimate how much potential revenue new customers from these segments could bring to the company on average.

**About Dataset**

The dataset "Persona.csv" contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and includes demographic information about the users who purchased these products. The dataset is composed of records generated from each sales transaction. In other words, the table has not been deduplicated. This means that a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.

- **Price**: Amount of money spent by the customer
- **Source**: Type of device the customer is connected to
- **Sex**: Gender of the customer
- **Country**: Country of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
